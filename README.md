# Rumanti.github.io
- Is my first GitHub page
- Is where I host my ScratchX extensions..
- ..And soon, my userscripts..

# What's with the CSS?? And the empty div's??
- I ripped this off my personal homepage. All I do is remove all my bookmarks there and add some random paragraph telling peoples nicely to look at my main site, Rumanti.cf :P
